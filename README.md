In this document, I discuss two articles about Retraction Watch, a database that collects retracted science papers which has gaines popularity in the COVID-era. I present and discuss two opposing views on what Retraction Watch shows us about the culture of science research.

## Article 1
In ScienceMag's [What a massive database of retracted papers reveals about science publishing’s ‘death penalty’](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty), Jeffrey Brainard and Jia You discuss a byproduct of the alarming rise in retracted articles. Citing a database called Retraction Watch, they argue that the rise in retractions is not caused by the epidemic of fraud in the science community so much as the community of scientific researchers policing themselves. They argue, however, this policing is still not enough, evidenced by several databases that have not reported any retractions since 2003. 

As an observer and participator of science, I understand that a retraction may not always be due to scientific misbehavior. Thus, pinning retractions as a culture of policing seems to paint an incomplete picture. Scientists should have the integrity to be aware of good and bad practice and their studies must be questioned should they be considered a result of misbehavior. This system of accountability is not necessarily policing, but rather a robust preventatory measure for releasing false or misleading information. Science can impact people on different scales based on the subject matter, thus having a revieweing system is and should be a part of the process. How this review system is established, however, is a much more complicated issue.


## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in NPR's piece on the issue, Reason magazine's [Publishing Ethics: An Interview With the Founders of Retraction Watch](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012809969800019X), Jasna Markovac, Molly Kleinman, Michael Englesbe, argue that the rise in retracted papers, as seem through the Retraction Watch database, is the result of fraud through a broken peer-review system that allows predatory publishers to take advantage of authors by promising conventional review but not going through.

I believe the peer-review system may need more scrutiny and predatory publishers should be revoked of their abilities to review. Beyond this, I dont belive individualizing peer-review is the solution. Scientific communities should establish themselves under a general review system that every study must be screened through. Faulty review systems are a part of the problem but they are not the only reason papers get retracted. The burden of misconduct likely comes from many other sources as well including falsified data, flawed images, and plagiarism.
